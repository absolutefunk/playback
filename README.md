OMNeT++ Inet Source-based playback of packet streams

This branch is for the INET 3.0 port of the playback framework.  Initial porting of the framework is complete.  As INET3 is still new, the current plan is to keep the master branch current with INET2.6, and port new modules as they are finished.
